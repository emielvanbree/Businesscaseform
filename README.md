Salesupply WMS Business Case Tool
About
This tool is a single-page interactive web application designed to help Business Owners at Salesupply complete a business case for WMS integration projects. It provides a structured form to input all relevant information, including strategic fit, value assessment, cost assessment, and risk analysis. The tool's primary function is to provide real-time KPI calculations and generate a downloadable Microsoft Word (.doc) document for formal submission.

Key Features
Guided Input: A clear, sectioned form guides the user through the necessary data points for a complete business case.

Real-time Calculations: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like total one-off costs, annual recurring costs, annual revenue, and ROI for years 1 and 3 are calculated and displayed instantly as the user enters data.

Word Export: A single click generates a properly formatted Word document (.doc) containing all the submitted data, ready for sharing and review.

Responsive Design: The application is built with Tailwind CSS to ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Initial Guidance: A landing page provides important instructions and disclaimers before the user proceeds to the main form.

Getting Started
To use this tool, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

The landing page will display a crucial message about the form's requirements and best practices.

Click the "Open Business Case Form" button to navigate to the main application.

Fill out all the fields in the form sections. The summary in the sidebar will update automatically with your inputs.

Once all information is entered, click the "Download Word (.doc)" button to save the final business case as a document.

Important Notes
All fields in this business case must be completed by the Business Owner.

Cost-related fields should be filled in after consultation with the BT department to ensure accuracy.

The Product Owner will review your business case and assess its value. Your request will then be prioritized in relation to other requests based on its potential impact and strategic importance.

The ROI calculation does not include the operational cost of fulfilment services. It reflects only the IT investment versus the expected revenue growth.

Technical Details
This application is built using a minimal front-end stack:

HTML5: For the page structure.

Tailwind CSS (via CDN): For all styling and responsive layout.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all interactive logic, real-time calculations, and document generation.
